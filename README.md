5. CSS Modules (https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).
6. Even though the radio station list is predefined - the application should be ready 
to accept the stations from the backend service without any refactoring.
7. Tests should not fail after switching to receive radio stations from the backend 
service.
8. Redux Saga or Redux could be used (not required).
9. Transition/motion smoothness would be appreciated (not required).
